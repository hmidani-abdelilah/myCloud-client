# myCloud

MyCloud is an application which allows you to host your own Cloud on your server.   
Thanks to this app, you can download, upload and manage your files.

Server is based on NodeJS  
Software is based on Qt/C++

## Motivation

Before beginning this project, I bought a personal cloud storage already created, but the software was very ugly and I cannot improve or modify anything. Because of that, I decided to create my own cloud to be very flexible

## Installation

In order to make the project work properly you have to install the server and the client.  
If you didn't install the server yet, I am invited you to install it [first](https://github.com/negrie-a/myCloud-client).

You just need to clone the project and start it with QtCreator


## Demo


### First use

When you start myCloud, you will find a pannel to connect youself.
Create an account to access to your pannel.
